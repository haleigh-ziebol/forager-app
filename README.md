# Forager

## Description

Foragers input the location and species along with a photo and notes for their foraging find. 
This data is stored on a map where they can view, edit and delete finds. 
When they input a new species, it counts toward foraging badges that a user can earn. 

## Prerequisites
Node.js <br />
PostgreSQL <br />
pgadmin 4 <br />

## Installation
Create a database named `forager-app`. <br />
The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. <br />
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install. <br />
Run npm run server in your terminal. <br />
Run npm run client in your terminal. <br />
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you! <br />
